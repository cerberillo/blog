          <div class="post-content"><p>Hey there,</p>

<p>It has been a couple of years pretty busy with my job at AppLift and PubNative, but the fact is that I would like to start writing my progression. Here is my new attempt and the starting point is moving the entire blog to Jekyll 3 which shown Itself very reliable and compatible with Github Pages :)</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>

          <div class="post-content"><p>I’ve just updated to OSX Yosemite, which I found lean in the graphical part and very useful and way more powerful with the dynamic conexion between devices.</p>

<p>Picking up my phone in the laptop, open a couple of webs in the laptop and continue reading in the device because all of them are connected never was more easy and with better user experience.</p>

<p>In other hand, I needed to do some Android java compilations and my ADT stopped working as soon as I installed OSX Yosemite.</p>

<p>The solution is to install a fix released by apple that will enable Java6 in your new OSX.</p>

<p>For all of you that wanted to test th latest from Apple but still want to work with Android, <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572">Here is the fix</a></p>

          <div class="post-content"><p>Finally I had some time to clean and extract some code from the dirt that I had in mind.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cerberillo/Croissant">You can find it here</a></p>

<p>This is a result of some bad experiences that I had with Objective-C, I’m talking about resource download. For some reason, Objective-C and Cocoa Isn’t enough prepared for downloading Async resources.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/URLLoadingSystem/Tasks/UsingNSURLConnection.html">I lie</a>, Apple published a full async resource downloader, but the bad news is that It has to be re-worked in the exact same way every project you create needing that (Because Apple developers are lazy).</p>

<p>So I decided to create a lean &amp; simple resource downloader based in this functionality. The good point here is that I took the time to create a Downloader queue that let you download a configurable number of resources at the same time.</p>

<p>It’s based in 2 different types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DownloaderQueue: Controls the queue MAX downloads and automatically starts new downloads when needed</li>
  <li>DownloadItem: Controls a single download and notify the origin class.</li>
</ul>

<p>Right now It has simple functionalities, download raw NSData and UIImages (for me, the 99% of the resources that are needed to be downloaded).</p>

<p>It’s easy to understand and easy to expand also with other types or queue control. I have in mind expanding it with pause/resume, so it will allow you to pause/resume long downloads (something that will be completely useless with iOS 8 and its background downloader).</p>

<p>In the air I have a question: Shall I remove all the block oriented code? In my experience It doesn’t justify the effort maintaining such a buggy paradigm for not implementing callbacks.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>

            <h1 class="post-title">Visiting Silicon Valley</h1>
          </header>
          <div class="post-meta">Jul 29, 2014</div>
          <div class="post-content"><p>Hi There!</p>

<p>I’ve recently visited Silicon Valley from San Francisco and just wanted to recap here how was it and give you some tips and tricks about how and what to visit.</p>

<p>We decided that we were going to go to Silicon Valley almost 2 days before going, so we just rented a car and start searching what to see.</p>

<p>Our trip</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Stanford: One of the best universities of the world, it worth a visit and don’t underestimate it, a simple visit worth 2 hours minimum (just walk around the computer engineer buildings, the bookshop and all around the campus).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Computer History museum: We wanted to go here, but our Stanford visit delayed a couple of hours and we decided to continue our trip.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Googleplex: Goolge HQ’s where you can do nothing but taking a picture. We entered in the “visitor center” to be told that it’s a private place and nothing inside buildings can be visited, neither the café or the shop (that’s what I was searching for).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apple: We went to Infinite loop street in cupertino and it looked also pretty much closed but with the exception that there’s an excelent place to have a lunch in front (BJ’s if I dont badly remember) and it has “The company store” like an apple store open to the public but with some company merchandising. It worth a visit to buy cheap stuff from the company and bring some special souverirs (Mugs, T-Shirts, Ballpens, etc).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Facebook: The most closed building of them all. Tinted glasses, security and a thumb’s up sign at the entrance of the “Hacker way” (Street where it is). It doesn’t deserve neither getting closer to it</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Believe it or not, this was a full day trip to Silicon valley and we didn’t had time for much more. I would recommend to visit Stanford, Apple and the Computer History museum that will have much more to see than Google or Facebook HQ’s.</p>

<p>Damn! A lot of things changed since the last time I did a website. This blog is a Start, I’m hosting it in Heroku, generating it with Jekyll &amp; started developing some services with Node.Js (I wanted to have some server new knowledge for testing).</p>

<p>So, a lot of new things came over here, I hope this goes forward as far as I want to :)</p>
